# Bank
Program in Java to check my knowledge. I will be realy grateful for some advices. I code this using TDD.

##Way of working
Actually dont have method main, work only tests, but cover all functionality.
All users have list of accounts (one user can have few accounts). On account can do transactions withdraw, deposit and transfer to another account. Transactions are saving list variable in account. Transaction remember user's id who make transaction, account's id, amount, date. If it's transfer, additionally remember recipient's account id number.
